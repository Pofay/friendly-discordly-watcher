## Building my own Discord Bot

This is part of my [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) weekly warmup and I've chosen to build a Discord bot based of this guide [**Node.js**: _Create a Discord bot_](https://discordjs.guide/) 
## Progress

I've gotten a walking skeleton now XD.

I've also found a lot of my weaknesses from starting this project

Namely:

- Using a different environment than what was written in the [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/) since I used Typescript instead of plain JavaScript for this project.
- Lack of Typescript familiarity (I assumed that I could wing it with my JS experience.)
- Lack of ESLint, Prettier and Husky Integration (I scoured through multiple sources just to get an environment that feels good enough to make this project which are listed below in the articles)


## Articles I've read to fix the environment issues
